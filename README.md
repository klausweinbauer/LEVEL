LEVEL is a C/C++ implementation for ETSI standardized communication protocols Co-operative Awareness Messages (CAM) and Decentralized Environmental Notification basic service Messages (DENM) for Windows and Linux. These protocols are used for vehicle to vehicle (V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communication. This implementation uses UDP as the transport layer and supports multiple encoding rules.
